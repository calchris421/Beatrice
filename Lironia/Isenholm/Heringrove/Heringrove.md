The Heringrove is a Colossal sized super organism formed from multiple continence's of druids who gave themselves to the wood

Protected by the majority of the remaining druidic circles and the remaining elves 

Very few villages exist in the wood however there are a few that exist

The wood does not look kindly on commonfolk entering the region however creatures that count as fey are welcomed
